                    Hello! I’m Daniel Chacón, originally from Bucaramanga, Colombia. I am a software developer specialized in backend, where I combine my passion for programming with a rigorous approach to architecture and efficiency.<br />
                    My career in software development has been a constant exploration of new technologies and methodologies to create innovative and scalable solutions.<br /><br />
                    Throughout my career, I have demonstrated my skills through various personal projects, ranging from frontend design to backend implementation. I have extensively worked with technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, React, and MongoDB, developing applications that not only meet functional requirements but also optimize performance and user experience.<br /><br />
                    Additionally, I have utilized version control technologies like GitHub to manage code and collaborate on projects effectively. My experience with these tools has allowed me to maintain an organized and efficient workflow, facilitating the integration and deployment of new features.<br /><br />
                    In every project, I focus on creating robust and maintainable solutions, applying industry best practices to ensure that each application not only functions optimally but also remains scalable and adaptable to future needs.
